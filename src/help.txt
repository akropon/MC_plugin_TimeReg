=== I. PLUGIN DESCRIPTION ===
=============================
 
    Target spigot version: 1.11.2
    Tested spigot versions: 1.11, 1.11.1, 1.11.2, 1.12, 1.12.1

    This plugin allows you to control running of time at your server.
For this the plugin can work in different modes. They are:
       0 - disabled: 
             Plugin is disabled.
       1 - mode-static: 
             Sets static time.
       2 - mode-full: 
             Full daylight cycle, but you can set speed of running time 
             in day and night separately.
       3 - mode-parted: 
             Time runs in interval, defined by two points: 
             start-time and finish-time.
       4 - mode-chaos: 
             Time changes it's direction randomly.
    Each mode has it's own additional settings, that you can set
in "config.yml" (recommended) or by server commands.

=============================
======= II. COMMANDS ========
=============================

    (Warning: Remember that when you want to type server command in game chat,
you should type symbol "/" before command and your player should have
necessary permissions (or just be the owner). When you want to type server 
command in server console, you shouldn't type symbol "/" before command.)

    All commands should begin from the word "timereg". Also instead of "timeger"
you can use "tmrg", "timeregulator", "regtime", "rgtm". It's all the same.

    Commands list:
    /timereg - little welcome message with "usage" description.
    /timereg info - more info about the plugin
    /timereg setmode <mode> - sets new mode
    /timereg disable - sets the mode to 0
    /timereg reload - reloads plugin. Use it, when u changed 
                      something in "config.yml" and want to make plugin
                      work with these new settings.
    /timereg setdaylightcycle <(1|true|yes)|(0|false|no)> - sets gamerule
                      named "daylightcycle" to true or false. You can do it
                      only if current mode is 0.
    /timereg settime <time> - sets new time. Works only if mode = 0 or 1.
    /timereg gettime - returns current time
    /timereg getmode - returns current mode
    /timereg setparam <path> <value> - (Do not recommend) sets new value
                        to certain parameter in "config.yml" and reloads
                        the plugin in the same moment. (Instead of this
                        recommend to change "config.yml" and reload plugin
                        yourself)


=============================
======= III. REMARKS ========
=============================

    1) Please, don't use "/time <set|add|query>" commands, when plugin
       is active (when mode is not 0), because this command or won't work
       or will break normal working of plugin (shouldn't happen).
    2) Please, don't use "/gamerule doDaylightCycle <value>" commands, when plugin
       is active (when mode is not 0), because this command 
       will break normal working of plugin.
    3) Inverse direction of running of time can cause changing of moon phases 
       every tick.
    4) When you activate this plugin, it will set gamerule "daylightcycle"
       to "false". When you deactivate this plugin, it won't set 
       gamerule "daylightcycle" back to "true". So, if you want to reset 
       normal dayligth cycle, use: "/timereg setdatlightcycle true" (if you 
       have this plugin) or "/gamerule doDaylightCycle true"
    5) Highly recommend to use this plugin at servers with only ONE world.

    If you notice any lags, bugs or crashes, which were caused by this plugin,
please, write to me on mail with description of the problem.
Also, if possible, attach server logs (it will help me a lot!), write
spigot version and list of plugins you used.

    U can write me in:
    - russian (the best way)
    - english (normal way)
    - spanish (as the last resort)

    (Remark: I know about the bug with moon phases when time is running 
in the opposite direction, so there is no need to write me about it.
Probably I'll fix it later).
